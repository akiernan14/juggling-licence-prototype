        You aren't eligible for a juggling licence
      </h1>

      <p>Juggling licences are issued to people who can juggle 3 or more balls. You have told us you can juggle less than 3 balls, so you aren't eligible at the moment.
      </p>

      <p> You can re-apply for a license at any time, for example if you learn a new skill. Previous applications will not affect future applications made. </p>
      <p>To understand why this is, <a href="/start">find out more about this subject</a>.</p>
